-client.conf
-===========
-
-System configuration of NDN platform is specified in ``client.conf``.
-Here is an example of ``client.conf`` for current ndn-cxx package:
-
-::
-
-    ; "unix_socket" specifies the location of the NFD unix socket
-    unix_socket=/var/run/nfd.sock
-
-    ; "protocol" determines the protocol for prefix registration
-    ; it has a value of:
-    ;   nrd-0.1
-    protocol=nrd-0.1
-
-    ; "pib" determines which Public Info Base (PIB) should used by default in applications.
-    ; If "pib" is not specified, the default PIB will be used.
-    ; Note that default PIB could be different on different system.
-    ; If "pib" is specified, it may have a value of:
-    ;   sqlite3
-    ; pib=sqlite3
-
-    ; "tpm" determines which Trusted Platform Module (TPM) should used by default in applications.
-    ; If "tpm" is not specified, the default TPM will be used.
-    ; Note that default TPM could be different on different system.
-    ; If "tpm" is specified, it may have a value of:
-    ;   file
-    ;   osx-keychain
-    ; tpm=file
-
-NFD
----
-
-unix_socket
-  The local interface of NFD to applications. By default, the path to the socket is ``/var/run/nfd.sock``.
-
-Prefix Registration
--------------------
-
-protocol
-  The prefix registration protocol. For now, only one protocol ``nrd-0.1`` is supported.
-  With this protocol, applications send prefix registration requests to NRD.
-  NRD, after authenticating the request, will set up corresponding FIB entries in NFD.
-
-Key Management
---------------
-
-tpm
-  Trusted Platform Module (TPM) where the private keys are stored.
-  Two options are currently available: ``file`` and ``osx-keychain``.
-  **Users are not supposed to change the ``tpm`` setting once it is configued,
-  otherwise users may face the problem of "Keys are not found".**
-  The default value of ``tpm`` depends on the operating system.
-  For OS X, the default value is ``osx-keychain``.
-  For other systems, the default value is ``file``.
-
-pib
-  The public key information for each private key stored in TPM.
-  There is only one option for ``pib``: ``sqlite3``, which is also the default value of ``pib``.
-
-Users are not supposed to change the configuration of Key Management.
-If changes is inevitable, please clean up the all the existing data (which is usually under ``~/.ndn/``):
-
-::
-
-    rm -rf ~/.ndn/ndnsec-*
